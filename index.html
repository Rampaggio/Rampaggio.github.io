                <p>It all started when my Grandmother heard my songs. I wrote some songs for my kids. Just to amuse myself and my wife mostly. Parenting is hard and it’s best to have a sense of humor about it. So I wrote some humorous songs about my kids, for my kids. Well, when my Grandmother heard these songs she was enamored. She thought they were the best thing since sliced bread. But to be fair, she might have been a tad biased. She was bugging me to record those songs. The rigors of the American Rat-Race were keeping me occupied. One of these days I said.
                </p>
                <p>I had been wanting a career change for awhile. Not so much of a hard turn but some continuing education that would compliment my current skill set. I started hearing about private coding schools and boot-camps. I had been interested in coding for some time but didn’t know how to get into it. I found a school in Austin where I could do a part time track to learn front end development. But I was going to need a little help with financing.
                </p>
                <p>I turned to my Grandmother for help. She asked again, “have you recorded those songs yet?” I had not. She agreed to help me pay for a coding school if I would bear down and record those songs. She thinks my future lies in a career of comedy song writing.</p>

                <p>One more thing. My Grandmother Loves Jimmy Kimmel. She thinks he hung the moon. She may be his biggest fan. Part of the agreement was that once recorded I had to “send the songs in” to the Jimmy Kimmel Show. For my shot at fame and fortune. Which I think is a terrible idea, but I was in no place to bargain.</p>
