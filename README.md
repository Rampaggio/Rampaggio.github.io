Atari Home Gaming Console

This project is an homage to the Atari 2600 Home Gaming Console.
My concept was to mimic a marketing campaign for a retro piece of hardware in a current web design style.
It's a past meets future experiment.
The Atari 2600 played a big role in my young life and created an early interest in computers and user interface.

I've used my anchors to sites that have other information about Atari and the games featured on this page.

I hope to accomplish a polished look that feels very modern. At the same time I want to recall a past that many people can relate to.
